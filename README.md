Greetings!
==========

This package will let you use the Note() API for Meteor Toys. 

```javascript
Note(message)
Note(message, "counter")
Note(message, data)
```

When you are working with Meteor Toys, it will dispaly the notifications in the UI. When you push to production, it will fall back to console.log();

More elaborate README coming soon.
